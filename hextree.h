     * Constructor that builds a HexTree out of the given PNG.
     * Every leaf in the tree corresponds to a pixel in the PNG.
     * Every non-leaf node corresponds to a rectangle of pixels
     * in the original PNG, represented by an (x,y) pair for the
     * upper left corner of the rectangle and an (x,y) pair for
     * lower right corner of the rectangle. In addition, the Node
     * stores a RGBAPixel representing the average colour over the
     * rectangle.
     *
     * The average colour for each node in your implementation MUST
     * be determined in constant time. HINT: this will lead to nodes
     * at shallower levels of the tree accumulating some error in their
     * average colour value, but we will accept this consequence in
     * exchange for faster tree construction.
     * Note that we will be looking for specific colour values in our
     * autograder, so if you instead perform a slow but accurate
     * average colour computation, you will likely fail the test cases!
     *
     * Every node's children correspond to a partition of the
     * node's rectangle into (up to) six smaller rectangles. The node's
     * rectangle is split evenly (or as close to evenly as possible)
     * along both horizontal and vertical axes. If an even split along
     * the vertical axis is not possible, the extra line(s) will be included
     * in either the middle section, or distributed to the left and right sections;
     * If an even split along the horizontal axis is not
     * possible, the extra line will be included in the upper side.
     * If a single-pixel-wide rectangle needs to be split, the left and right children
     * will be null.
     * If a single-pixel-tall rectangle needs to be split,
     * the lower children will be null.
     *
     * In this way, each of the children's rectangles together will have coordinates
     * that when combined, completely cover the original rectangle's image
     * region and do not overlap.
